## 🧩 Wireframe Elements

Wireframes are visual blueprints that outline the structure and functionality of a digital product before detailed design begins. They help teams focus on **usability**, **layout**, and **user flow** without getting distracted by colors or styling.

### 🗂️ Layout Structure
Defines the overall arrangement of components on the screen.

**Example**:  
In a hotel booking app, the layout might include a header for navigation, a main content area for hotel listings, and a sidebar for filters. This structure ensures users can easily scan and interact with key features.

### 🧭 Navigation
Shows how users move between different sections or pages.

**Example**:  
A top navigation bar with links to “Search Hotels,” “My Bookings,” and “Profile” helps users quickly access core features. Wireframes often use placeholder text like “Nav” or “Menu” to indicate these elements.

### 📝 Content Placement
Indicates where text, images, and interactive elements will appear.

**Example**:  
Hotel cards might include placeholders for hotel name, image, rating, and price. Proper placement ensures users can compare options at a glance.

### ⚙️ Functionality
Represents interactive components like buttons, forms, and filters.

**Example**:  
A “Book Now” button, date picker, or search field are shown as simple boxes or labels. These elements guide developers on what actions users should be able to perform.

> Together, these elements create a clear and intuitive user experience, helping designers and developers align before diving into high-fidelity design or coding.

## 🧮 Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail, depending on the stage of the design process. The two most common types are **low-fidelity** and **high-fidelity** wireframes.

### 📝 Low-Fidelity Wireframes
These are simple, sketch-like representations of a layout. They focus on structure and user flow rather than visual design.

**Used for**:
- Early brainstorming and ideation
- Rapid prototyping and feedback
- Exploring layout options without distractions

**Characteristics**:
- Minimal styling (black and white, basic shapes)
- Placeholder content (e.g., “Image here”, “Button”)
- No interactivity

### 🎨 High-Fidelity Wireframes
These are polished, detailed mockups that closely resemble the final product. They include design elements and sometimes interactivity.

**Used for**:
- Finalizing layout and visual design
- Developer handoff
- Stakeholder presentations

**Characteristics**:
- Real content and images
- Typography, colors, and spacing
- May include clickable elements

## 🔍 Wireframe Type Used in This Project

The wireframe used in this project is a **low-fidelity wireframe**. It was designed to focus on layout structure, user flow, and core functionality without visual distractions. This approach allowed for quick iteration and clear communication of system behavior during the requirement analysis phase.

> As the project evolves, this wireframe can be refined into a high-fidelity version for UI design and development handoff.
